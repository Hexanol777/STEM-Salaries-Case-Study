# Data Analysis Project: Income Category Prediction

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on predicting income categories using classification algorithms. The project was completed as part of a university course and aims to showcase data analysis, machine learning modeling, and presentation skills.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Predict income categories based on various features using classification algorithms.
- **Data:** Utilized a dataset containing information about individuals and their income levels.
- **Approach:** Explored different classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees.
- **Highlights:** Explored data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.
- **Key Results:** Successfully built and compared multiple models, with certain cases where the Decision Tree outperformed Random Forest.
