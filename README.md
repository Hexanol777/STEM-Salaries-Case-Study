# STEM-Salaries-Case-Study

This project explores the application of decision tree and random forest models for regression tasks. It includes an analysis of different model configurations and parameter settings, along with evaluation metrics and techniques for interpreting the models. The project demonstrates the comparison of decision tree and random forest models on a specific dataset, highlighting the superior performance of the decision tree approach. The accompanying notebook, data, and images provide a comprehensive overview of the project's findings and can serve as a valuable resource for understanding and implementing these machine learning techniques.
